# Mirakel

Mirakel is a free Wunderlist clone.
The aim is to develop a Webapp (in Ruby on Rails), a desktop-application (in Python) and an Android-App.
You have the ability to run your own Mirakel-Server and sync your Client-Applications with your Server.

## Try it

Here you can try Mirakel: http://mirakel.azapps.de/

This application is still **alpha**. no guarantees are given for any functionality or data persistance.

I will try to set up a goodâ€“working application, when Mirakel leaves the alpha-status.

* Email: test@example.com
* Password: test123

## Install

Clone the Git-repository and run the following commands:

    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:migrate

Then you can run a server via

    $ rails server
