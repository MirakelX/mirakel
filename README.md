# Mirakel

Mirakel is a free Wunderlist clone.
The aim is to develop a Webapp (in Ruby on Rails), a desktop-application (in Python) and an Android-App.
You have the ability to run your own Mirakel-Server and sync your Client-Applications with your Server.

## Try it

There will be soon a test-server where you can test Mirakel.

## Install

Clone the Git-repository and run the following commands:

  $ bundle install
  $ rake db:migrate

Then you can run a server via

  $ rails server
